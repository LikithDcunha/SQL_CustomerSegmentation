Introduction

Customer segmentation is a key component of marketing strategies. The RFM analysis is a popular method for customer segmentation. It uses three metrics - Recency, Frequency, and Monetary - to categorize customers into different groups based on their purchase behavior.

In this analysis, we will use MySQL to conduct RFM analysis on our customer data. We will use SQL window functions to segment our customers based on their RFM scores.

Data
The data used for this analysis is stored in the SQL dump file named sales_rfm.sql. The dataset includes customer transaction data, including the purchase amount and date.

To import the data into MySQL, you can follow these steps:

Create a new database named SALES_RFM by running the following command:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE SALES_RFM;
Make sure that you are inside the directory where the sales_rfm.sql file is located.
Run the following command to load the dump file into MySQL:
css
Copy code
mysql -u your_username -p SALES_RFM < sales_rfm.sql
Make sure to replace your_username with your MySQL username.
Once the import is complete, you should see a message indicating that the table was successfully created inside the SALES_RFM database.


Methodology

The RFM analysis consists of three metrics:

Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase
Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase
Monetary: How much a customer spends on each purchase
Each of these metrics is scored based on the customer's behavior. The scores are then combined to create an RFM score for each customer.

In this analysis, we will use SQL window functions to calculate the RFM scores and segment the customers into different groups based on their scores.

Instructions

To run this analysis, you will need to:

Import the customer transaction data into MySQL using the LOAD DATA INFILE command.
Run the SQL script to calculate the RFM scores and segment the customers.
Analyze the results and identify the different customer segments.
Future Work

This analysis is a work in progress. In the future, we plan to:

Visualize the results using charts and graphs.
Refine the segmentation based on additional customer data.
Analyze the effectiveness of different marketing strategies for each customer segment.
